We are excited to announce the release of the first Profiles Dashboard today. The focus of this dashboard is Media Consumption across the US population. 

## What are Profiles dashbaords? 

Profiles dashboards are the next iteration of Data Packs released earlier this year and are designed to provide quick and easy visual insights into different areas and sectors of Profiles data. The dashboard  can be used by new and experienced users alike to explore commonly used variables and analysis using Profiles data. 

Pre-built analyses are presented using tables and graphs, for readily accessible key findings. Double-clicking on any analysis in a dashboard will bring you into the dataset, where you can customize the analysis by swapping out variables. 

Dashboards are still being developed and will be customizable in future. While we continue to develop existing dashboards, we will also be releasing more Data Packs that focus on other key sectors.


## What is included in the Media Consumption dashboard?

The dashboard consist of insights about media consumers, including: 

•	The best channels to reach certain demographics
•	Audiences’ preferences in consuming content online, in print, and via audio formats
•	How modern consumers use social media
•	How modern consumers engage with out-of-home media

## Where can I find the Media Consumption dashboard? 

When accessing Profiles, you will find a “View dashboard” button in the upper right corner, next to the search bar, which will bring you to the dashboard. If you are in the dashboard, simply hit the “View dataset” button in the same place to get back to the dataset or double click any analysis to get right to it in the dashboard.
