We are excited to announce the release of the third Profiles Data Packs today. The focus of the this Data Pack is Retail, where we dive into how and where the US population buys clothing or groceries, consumes mass merchandise or uses loyalty schemes. 

## What are data packs? 
Data Packs are designed to provide quick and easy insights into different areas and sectors of Profiles data, having relevant analyses only a few clicks away. Data Packs can be used by new and experienced users alike to explore commonly used variables and analysis using Profiles data.
